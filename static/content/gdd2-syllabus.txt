The main thing we'll be doing in this class is taking the projects that were paper prototyped last quarter and building them out this quarter, so amore than half of class time is studio time.  The rest of the class time will be dedicated to lecture and/or discussion on production process and other industry related topics.  Some of these are detailed belowWe'll have 5 teams working from design documents that have been through a full blown process from gdd1 to make into digital games.  Teams will end up being at least partially different with new folks joining and perhaps in some cases previous team members joining  a different projectThe list on the following page is solid through 9/24.  The rest will be defined at the end of  the month after we know where we are in the process.Your Grade will come from…Weekly Production Blogs: 					20%Team document Deliverables (Design Docs, development plans, etc)			30%Digital Game Development					30%Peer Evals							20%
